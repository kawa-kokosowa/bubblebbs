# bubblebbs

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/lily-mayfield/bubblebbs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lily-mayfield/bubblebbs)

Text BBS/message board which runs [bubblebbs.cafe](http://bubblebbs.cafe).

This project is in alpha. It is currently unversioned and very messy.

Features:

  * Cookie manager allows users to control name-remembering and custom
    stylesheets
  * Trip meta pages exist as soon as the tripcode is used when creating a post!
    You can edit these pages by supplying a string which hashes to that
    tripcode! Shows posts by that tripcode, as well as post counts!
  * Tripcodes salted by both secret *and* the poster's name. This prevents
    identity-jacking (in the event users happened to use the same password).
  * Flags IPs which use a name with a tripcode that doesn't match the original
    occurence of name's tripcode
  * Prefixes "verified" names with a green checkmark. Verified names are posts
    which have a tripcode matching the tripcode of the first post with said name.
  * Markdown support, optional headline syntax
  * Google Recaptcha
  * Create pages
  * Word filter lets you not only filter words (also pattern matches on
    plurals), but "flag" IP addresses that use those words
  * Automatically ban users based on certain phrases
  * Manage site through backend
  * Site blotter
  * Doesn't allow duplicate posts
  * Tripcodes hash to color and emoji
  * Fluid default stylesheet
  * Full text search

## General technical

Before you start:

  * Make sure you're using latest Docker and docker-compose, install according to
    Docker community instructions, don't install via your distribution's repo (it's
    probably way out-of-date!).
  * Docker will look for `.env-file`. So you need to `touch .env-file`. This
    includes setting up your Google Recaptcha info. Here are possible
    `.env-file` settings:
    * `BBBS_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
    * `BBBS_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`
    * `BBBS_SECRET_KEY`

There are multiple ways to run the app:

  * For production: Use Docker, `./launch-docker.sh prod`
  * To debug: either look at the "debugging without docker" section in this
    `README` or use `./launch-docker.sh debug`
  * Running tests: if you followed the "debugging without docker" section you
    can simply run `pytest` in the project root. Otherwise use
    `./launch-docker.sh pytest`.

Admins login at `/admin` with the default username `admin` and default password `admin`.

## Debugging without Docker

You can still fiddle around with `bubblebbs` like you would any ol' Python code:

  1. Create and activate a virtual environment
  1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  1. In Ubuntu I needed to `sudo apt install libssl-dev` (this is for `scrypt`)
  1. `python3 -m bubblebbs.runserver`
  1. http://localhost:8080/

You can run tests with `pytest` in the project root.
